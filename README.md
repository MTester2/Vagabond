Even though we're on Github, we're going to be using the SVN format.  I think the clients and overall, it's easier to use than GIT, and since most of you haven't used GIT before, I think this is an easier start.

See https://help.github.com/articles/support-for-subversion-clients/ for help getting started checking this repo out.  As we get moving, I may add more details to this file, to help you get moving.
